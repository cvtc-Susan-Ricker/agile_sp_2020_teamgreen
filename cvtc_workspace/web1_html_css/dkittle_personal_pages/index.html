      <p>I was born in Virginia, and I lived there until I was 10 when we moved to New Hampshire. When I was 20, I did some traveling and ended in Medford WI. I needed money, so I quickly got a job at a factory. In 2002 I moved to the Eau Claire area. With encouragement from friends, I decided to get to an education. I graduated from CVTC and UW-Stout.</p>
      <p>Currently, Sr. Technical Support Engineer at Jamf. I've been working in Jamf's Support Department for five years.</p>
      <p>Hobbies</p>
      <ul>
        <li>BJJ, Muay Thai and Kick boxing </li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Exercise</li>
        <li>Currently I'm playing Residnet Evil 2 on PS4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After I graduate I'd like to be a Software Engineer in Test (SET), maybe a Software Engineer in the Sustaining department at Jamf. </p>
