            Genki Sudo was one of the weirdest MMA fighters, especially on his feet.
            Look up Manon Gibson, now imagine him drunk that's Genki Sudo.

            Perhaps the greatest western Muay Thai fighter of all time is Ramon Dekker.
            In his prime, Ramon Dekker would go into Thailand and fight the best Thai fighters of the golden era.
            He came out of retirement to challenge Genki Sudo for a truly awkward match.
