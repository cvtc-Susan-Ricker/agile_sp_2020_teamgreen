            <h3>Pound-for-pound best in Muay Thai history</h3>
            <h5>Featured Athlete | March 6th 2019</h5>
            <p>
              Pound-for-pound best in Muay Thai history, Saenchai is practically 100-1 against foreign opponents.
              He has fought some of the best competitors and has come out on top.
              Saenchai's been winning fights for the past 30 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is known as a great showman, perhaps the greatest that Muay Thai has ever seen.
              Everyone who watches his fights is astounded by his ability.
              Saenchai is one of the most creative and intelligent fighters to have been.
            </p>
            <p>
              Saenchai is famous for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Teep: Normal Teep, Thigh Teep, Side Teep, Rear Teep.</li>
              <li> Kicking Trickery: Direction and Level Changes.</li>
              <li> The lean back and Sweep.</li>
              <li> And of course, his acrobatics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              He's at such a high level in Muay Thai that if anyone from outside the sport wanted to fight him, they would lose badly.
              If Floyd Mayweather or McGregor wanted to fight Saenchai, and if kicking were allowed, he is at such a high level it would be horrific to watch.
            </p>
            <p>
              At 37 years old Saenchai still fights every couple of weeks, he even fights people that are way bigger than him.
              While he knocks a lot of his opponents out, most of his fights are won by overwhelming them with things they can't deal with.
              With his High Ring IQ, he kicks and hits his opponents when they aren't looking.
              He is smart and fast in the ring.
