          <h3>Genki Sudo vs Ramon Dekker.</h3>
          <h5>Fight | March 6th 2019</h5>
          <p>
            Genki Sudo was one of the weirdest MMA fighters, especially on his feet.
            Look up Manon Gibson, no imagine him drunk that's Genki Sudo.
            On the ground, however, was dangerous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps the greatest western Muay Thai fighter of all time is Ramon Dekker.
            In his prime, Ramon Dekker would go into Thailand and fight the best Thai fighters of the golden era.
            He came out of retirement to challenge Genki Sudo for a truly awkward match.
          </p>
          <p>
            Genki Sudo is a master at frustrating his opponent and getting them to rush in.
            By staying a long way away he gives his opponent a lot of time to react.
            This style is very different for traditional striking.
            When Ramon Dekker steps in Genki goes in for a successful takedown.
            One the ground Ramon Dekker is open to attack and Genki is safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the adjustment, Genki grabs Ramon's ankle and sits back and into Ashi Garami.
            Not being a grappler Ramon fumbles around for a bit but eventually get to his feet and threaten Genki Sudo with stikes.
            Genki is able to take away Ramon's base and finish the match with a heel hook. <br><br>
